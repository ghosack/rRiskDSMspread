# rRiskDSMspread
Suite of code, and documentation to reproduce the results presented in the article by Ickowciz et al (2021) modelling the spread and dispersal of dominant sterile male mosquitoes.

The package is organized as follows:

- the R directory stores the functions used to run the analysis
- the inst/code_article directory stores the different scripts used in the analysis. By running the script you reproduce the analysis
- the inst/extdata directory stores different external datasets used in the analysis
- the inst/manuscript directory stores the manuscript in both pdf and tex format
